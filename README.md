# TODO Web App

This is a simple TODO Web App that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The app utilizes local storage to save the tasks, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed. The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their TODO list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit the text of existing tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can click on a task to mark it as completed or uncompleted.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their list when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.
