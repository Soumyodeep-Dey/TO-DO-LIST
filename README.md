# TODO Web App

This is a simple TODO Web App that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, delete tasks, and the app utilizes local storage to save the tasks, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed. The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their TODO list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their list when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.

## Live Demo

The app is live and can be accessed at: [TODO Web App](https://soumyodeep-dey.github.io/TO-DO-LIST/)

## How to Use

1. **Adding a Task:** 
   - Enter a task in the input field.
   - Click the "Add" button or press "Enter" to add the task to the list.

2. **Deleting a Task:** 
   - Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

3. **Persistent Storage:** 
   - All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they will remain available even if the page is reloaded or the browser is closed and reopened.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web app.
- **CSS3:** For styling the app.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the app's functionality, including adding and deleting tasks, as well as managing local storage.
